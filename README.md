It's common to overlook the possibility of integrating security across the entire Software Development Lifecycle and leaving it until the end. However, embedding security principles and practices into daily processes diminishes security-related risks. Taking a proactive stance and embracing secure coding standards from the outset is imperative. Security considerations should ideally be addressed before any coding commences during discussions on coding principles and standards. The implementation of Defense in Depth's preventative aspect right from the start significantly reduces security risks.


Security threats can emerge from various sources, whether internal or external. The driving force behind decision-making processes should be the assessment of risks associated with daily choices. It's important to recognize that the threats we face today may differ from those we encounter tomorrow, and neglecting any potential threat can lead to significant consequences. The expense of addressing these threats is minimal compared to the costs of managing the risks linked to each one. Essential practices include implementing straightforward coding techniques, conducting frequent and early testing, and conducting static code analyses after each code modification. Automated unit testing and penetration testing should also be consistently performed to enhance security measures.


Given the significant advancements in technology, it's imperative to adopt a zero-trust mindset consistently, as conventional authentication approaches are proving inadequate. Verification is essential for every user, device, network, and data access and application. To enhance user authentication, we've integrated methods like biometrics and multifactor authentication in addition to conventional usernames and passwords. Moreover, there's a trend toward modernizing applications by implementing Single-Sign-On access verification.

Security policies provide a framework to uphold the safety of code and data. It's essential for every company to create, maintain, review, and adhere to these policies. They encompass fundamental principles, coding standards, and best practices that should be integrated into all development projects. Consistent adherence to security policies ensures uniform implementation for maintaining safety.
Since technology has started evolving at a fast pace, the FTC has several lessons learned. This has allowed to suggestions to speak to common vulnerabilities that have affect many organizations in the past, lesson learned. Some of these lessons include security, such as controlling user access to data, user authentication, and storing and transmitting data securely. Other best practices ensure that software is kept up to date and that patches are applied promptly for users. Requirements for passwords and such is a must.
